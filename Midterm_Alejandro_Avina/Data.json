        "name": "Thread Tap",
        "description": "A tap is a metal cutting tool used to create internal screw threads inside a hole. It works by removing small amounts of material as it is turned into the drilled hole. Taps come in different types, such as taper, plug, and bottoming, depending on how deep the threads need to go. They are commonly used in metalworking and mechanical repair to prepare holes for bolts or screws.",

        "description": "A CNC probe is a precision sensor used to measure the position, dimensions, or surface of a workpiece directly on a CNC machine. It helps automate setup and inspection by detecting contact with the part and sending feedback to the machineâ€™s control system. This improves accuracy, reduces setup time, and minimizes human error during machining operations.",
